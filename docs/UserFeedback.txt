Omar -
- confused as to enter food items, meals or recipes ("food items" too vague?)
- serving size table is more useful, put it on top
+ interface is clean, similar to google
- red font saying "item not found" if food not found, instead of countdown page
- compare button should be bigger than clear choices button
+ having the two tables for per 100g and per serving size was not too confusing

Mihailo
- not clear what the site does (replace "please enter food items")
- on mobile, it's not obvious you can scroll horizontally (maybe may scroll bar visible always), or make a vertical scroll
- include more specific details: why one thing is healthier (it has less sodium, etc)

Raj
+ Website is simple
- add a "go back to main menu" or something. it's not clear the logo does this.

Micheal
- Maybe have a toggle switch for the two tables
- not clear what website does when first opening
- make it more obvious which is more healthy instead of tiny sentence

Chen
- How it works page has too much writing.
- Took a while to figure out the two charts
- typing in apple should show different types of apples in autocomplete
  
Sirine
+ Pretty clear
+ Actually read the How It Works page
- Maybe emphasize the how it works, or show user what will happen 
- possibly highlight "how it works"
- If user doesnt specify "with peel" or "without peel" they would expect just 
  cucumber. Or display both of them.
- Cucumber without peel returns "potato without peel"
- Make it a choice for the user (per grams or per serving)
- add more explanation as to which is healthier

Anonymous
- Home page seems empty
- queried items were different from input

Overall, everyone says the general layout is nice and clean
