Next steps:

I talked to some CS friends who gave me some tips. I managed to successfully query the food database, it actually 
wasn't that hard. So here's what we have to do now:

We have to create a function in index.html and set the on click action of the "Compare" button to call that function.
The function builds the appropriate query, fires off the request, and returns data. 

1) When we click the "Compare" button, we need to read the inputs from the text boxes to get the food items
2) Call the function that builds the query and fires off the request to the databases
3) Display the returned data
