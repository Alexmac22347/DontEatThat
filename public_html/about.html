               	This web application was originally developed for a group project in CPEN 321 - Software Engineering. The idea for this
				web application came from the book "Eat This, Not That!". The book is a nutritional guide that compares foods from the 
				same genre and recommends the healthier choices. However, we felt that the book had several shortcomings. First, the book
				had a rather limited selection of foods, with approximately 12 per genre. All the choices were displayed together, making it 
				difficult for a user to compare two choices side by side. <br><br>
				
				Don't Eat That! was developed to allow a user to compare a wide variety of foods side by side. The Web Application displays
				the nutritional information of the user's inputs and also recommends the healthier choice for the user's needs.
